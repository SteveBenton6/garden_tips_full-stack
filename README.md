# Garden Tips

Garden Tips is a site that is targetted towards gardeners - both experienced and less experienced.  Experienced gardeners can post garden tips - including an image, with some context on their location and season to help understand the relevance of the tip.  These can be edited and deleted by the creator.  Less experienced gardeners can provide feedback on the tips, including a score.  This feedback can be edited by the feedback provider.

All tip and feedback content (new and updated) is reviewed by admin before publishing to prevent inappropriate content being published.

## Design

-   ### Two Page Core Site
    -  The core of the site is based on the Home Page, which contains the active Garden Tip infomration for users, an About page which describes the purpose of the site and a detailed individual tip page reached by clicking a specific Garden Tip title.

-   ### Action Screens
    -  Clicking links brings up other views - e.g. User Registration, User Login, Create New Garden Tip, Edit New Garden Tip, Delete Garden Tip, Logout, etc.  On completion of these activites the user is typically returned to the Home page. 

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  For a Gardening site, Green will be the predominant colour.  Much of this is provided by the images and the feature garden image above the navigation bar.  A "Hunter Green" - #074507 was used to complement this on the site.

    [Hunter Green](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/colors/hunter-green/)
    
-   ### Typography
    - Google Fonts were used to import Roboto and Lato fonts into styles.css.  These look professional but informal for the Garden blog theme.

## Testing 


### Validator Testing 

- HTML

### Unfixed Bugs

- When a piece of Feedback is edited - the existing Feedback score is not presented in the form (athough cleaerly visible on the page).  This view to be further enhanced to include the urrent feedback score in the edit form.
- The Garden Tip Image Sizes alter the Home Page view.  Additional styling code to be developed to manage the image sizes (and whether Portrait r Landscape) displayed in the Home Page view of Grsening Tips.


## Deployment

- The site was edited in GitPod, with Git used to update the GitHub repository page with the latest version of the code.
- The Project required an SQL database and a Cloudinary account for storage of the project images.  These were set up.
- The project required three environmental settings to work that needed to remain confidential:
  - Secret key to run the application
  - Secret Key to interact with the SQL database
  - Secret Key to interact with the Cloudinary image storage
These 3 keys were stored in an env.py file, which was included in gitignore and so not uploaded to GitBub and so not revealed.

- A Garden Tips project was set up in the Heroku application.
  - The three secret environemntal settings, detailed above, were recorded in Heroku.
  - Heroku was set to use the repository code in GitHub.
  - Before final deployment in Heroku - the settings.py value in the code was set to DEBUG = False (with git used to get this onto GitHub).
  - The project was deployed in Heroku.

## Credits 

### Content 

- The project base was influneced by the LMS Blog Project.
- Additional model varianbles, styling, views, urls and HTML were added to provide the full requested CRUD capability.  Garden Tips can be Created, Edited and Deleted with controls in to limit actions to the relevant registered users.  All new and edited Garden Tip and Feedback material goes to admin for approval to ensure no inappropriate material is posted.  The admin views have been enhanced to give admin better visibility on what needs to be reviewed/approved.

### Media

- All media images are my own.
- The fonts used were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

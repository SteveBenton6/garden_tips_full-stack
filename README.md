# Garden Tips

Garden Tips is a site that is targetted towards gardeners - both experienced and less experienced.  Experienced gardeners can post garden tips - including an image, with some context on their location and season to help understand the relevance.  These can be edited and deleted by the creator.  Less experienced gardeners can provide feedback on the tips, including a score.  This feedback can be edited by the feedback provider.

All tip and feedback content (new and updated) is reviewed by admin before publishing to prevent inappropriate content being published.

## Features 

### Features Completed

- __Landing Page__
  - The site consists of a single landing page which clearly identifies the purpose of the site, is responsive and allows the user to enter their location and get a Weather Forecast.  On first entering the site a large banner is shown in the midle of the screen to explain it.  This banner is removed once the user enters a location and requests a weather forecast.  It is then replaced with the Sun Clouds Rain scoring statement.

![Header](./assets/suppdocs/siteOpenScreenshot.png)

- __Capture Search Location for Weather__

  - The site has a clearly marked input field for the user to enter the location that they want for the weather forecast.  A country pull down is also included, to help resolve any issues arising from identical location names in different countries.  At this stage only a limited number of countries have been added and future work is needed to increase the country coverage. It defaults to the UK.

- __Capture First name for Sun Clouds Rain Game__

  - The site has a clearly marked input field for the user to enter their first name.  Which is then used as part of the Sun Clouds Rain game to tailor the score messaging.

- __Submit Search Location for Weather Forecast__

  - The site has a clearly marked search (submit) button - to submit the location and get a Weather Forecast.  This button also submits the first name for the first round of the Sun Clouds Rain game.
  - When this button is clicked - the orange information banner is also removed from the screen and replaced with the scoring statement for the Sun Clouds Rain Game.

- __Confirmation of Location__

  - Todays weather togther with confirmation of the Location is displayed after search (submit) is clicked.

### Features Left to Implement

- Countries: an initial 5 countris have been added for the country validation activity.
	- This list to be extnded to cover a wider range of countries.
  - Investigate better use of the existing API to facilitate this.

- Display of Weather Location on a Map
	- It would be good to show a Google Map (or similar) of the location entered for the weather to help validate the weather is for the location expected.
  - Investigate how the goggle maps API could be used to provide this.

- Multiple round scoring
  - To encourage repeated use of the site, add an ongoing score capability that extemds the scoring across multiple rounds.

## Design

-   ### Single Page
    -  We decided that the site should be based on using a single page. Using JavaScript to dynamically change the display based on user entry.  A bootstrap modal was selected to display the game rules.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  We decided that blue colours (clouds) mixed with bright (weather) colours would work for our website. Including blue was important to underpin the link to weather. The colours picked were generated using the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

        ![Colour Palette](./assets/suppdocs/sunCloudsRainColourPalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    - Google Fonts were used to import Caveat and Maragrine fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they looked informal and related to the use of the site by children.
 
    ![Font Pairing](./assets/suppdocs/googlefonts.png)   

-   ### Logo/Icon
    - The logo design incorporates a smiling sun character image. This to reflect weather, the focus on younger users and creating fun from the game. The logo was generated using [bing copilot designer](https://www.bing.com/chat?q=Microsoft+Copilot&FORM=hpcodx)

- An ideation process was undertaken to suggest and prioritise the user experience for the site.  From this user stories were generated, prioritised (including establishing a Minimum Viable Product) and managed using a Kanban board on GitHub.

- Each user story:
  - Included Acceptance Criteria and Tasks.
  - Was tagged with its MoSCoW priority rating.
  - Was assigned an owner.
  - Was managed by the owner across to Done

- The Kanban board was regulalry reviewed bu the team.

  -   #### Kanban Board

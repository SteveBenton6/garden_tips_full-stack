# Garden Tips

Garden Tips is a site that is targetted towards gardeners - both experienced and less experienced.  Experienced gardeners can post garden tips - including an image, with some context on their location and season to help understand the relevance of the tip.  These can be edited and deleted by the creator.  Less experienced gardeners can provide feedback on the tips, including a score.  This feedback can be edited by the feedback provider.

All tip and feedback content (new and updated) is reviewed by admin before publishing to prevent inappropriate content being published.

## Design

-   ### Two Page Core Site
    -  The core of the site is based on the Home Page, which contains the active Garden Tip infomration for users, an About page which describes the purpose of the site and a detailed individual tip page reached by clicking a Graden Tip title.

-   ### Action Screens
    -  Clicking links brings up other views - e.g. User Registration, User Login, Create New Garden Tip, Edit New Garden Tip, Delete Garden Tip, Logout, etc.  On completion of these activites the user us typically returned to the Home page. 

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  We decided that blue colours (clouds) mixed with bright (weather) colours would work for our website. Including blue was important to underpin the link to weather. The colours picked were generated using the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

        ![Colour Palette](./assets/suppdocs/sunCloudsRainColourPalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    - Google Fonts were used to import Caveat and Maragrine fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they looked informal and related to the use of the site by children.
